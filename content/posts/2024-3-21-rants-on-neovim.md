You open your laptop and what is the first thing you do? Well, I open my terminal and start vim. That's where I spend most of my time these days. Before vim, I used EMACS for about 5 years and it was about time I switch to vim(neovim, but you get the point). And this is the post where I compare my experience with EMACS vs VIM.

When I first started programming, I started with sublime text. Problem with sublime, I was using it for free. There were random popups on save. I hated that and also sublime is too graphical for me. Then the day came, I saw someone using EMACS and going 10x my speed. And at that moment, I decided I am going to use EMACS, and I used it from vanilla EMACS to Spacemacs to Doomemacs. But, the pain was always there with LISP.

## EMACS is Good
Because I switched to NeoVim, I am not going to lie, EMACS is a very good editor. EMACS has everything from text-modes like org-mode, good plugin supports, provides a good editing experience. It provided a rich set of plugins to develop on any programming languages or frameworks. Has a good git support with Magit, so you don't leave your editor to commit your changes or push changes to remote. There are lots of plugins that can be easily configured for things like snippets, completions, lately the support for LSPs are in-built.

### What I miss?
#### Org mode
#### Magit
#### Org Agendas

### Why?
#### Elisp

## NeoVim is Better
