This is going to be one of my long rants and nothing technical. I have seen a lot of queries in reddit where people(mainly students and juniors) asking what do they have to do
to prepare for jobs? What skills do they need to have for a successful jobs? This is my own perspective on things and let me know what do you think of these. The things I am about to talk about mainly is for
programmers or someone in the tech field and want to write code for life.

# jobs, future and skills?
You may have been thinking about the type of job you want, the future you want for yourself and what type of skills do you need to have job/future you want? These things are much intertwined 
that people want to see about just the intersection. I am going to ask you some questions, answer them before continuing reading:
- [ ] What do you think is a good job means?
- [ ] What is your passion? What is the one thing that you think you are passionate about? for eg: mobile? system? data? web?

But hold on, you are here because you can't decide what is what? You may not have found your passion? You may not have skills? You may have a job but you don't have skills to grow?

I remember not knowing anything while I was in college specially in the early days (That's why I am still learning C :D). And there was a point when I thought about programming and nothing at all.
Later the same year when I got my laptop, I realized how fascinating programming is. I remember installing linux mint for the first time, that was a game changer. Countless hours in linux, wiping my hard disk like a thousand times. The first time I made my todo app in Rails, the first time I learned about
the command line, ls, cd commands. 

So, what does skills mean? I was giving my background because skills mean adapting to things. You start with something simple like `print("hello world")` and you end up writing `Bread First Search Algorithm` by yourself few years later. Your skills grow over time. 
Your experience is not your skill but your skill is your experience. I have seen my juniors writing programs so vast that I could not comprehend. Your experience grows based on your skills.
