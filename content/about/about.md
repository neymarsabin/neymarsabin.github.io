ðŸ‘‹ Hey folks! I am **Sabin Nepal**. I'm a Software Engineer navigating the intricate realms of coding with a love for simplicity and effectiveness. With a solid background in **Ruby on Rails**, **NodeJS** and **ReactJS**, I bring a dynamic skill set to the table. I also like to try languages like **Rust** and **Golang** when I feel exhausted from the world of interpreters.

Having delved into the exciting world of **blockchain**, I've woven intricate connections between frontend development and smart contracts. Crafting **ReactJS Web3** frontends and seamlessly integrating them with **blockchain nodes** is where I thrive.

In the techspace, I'm not just a coder; I'm a navigator through **AWS**, proficient in its services and world of containerization with **ECS**and **EKS**. **Docker** and **Git** are my trusted companions, and the command line is where I feel most at home.

```
In the realm of bits and bytes, where logic meets creativity, 
code becomes the poetry that defines the future.
