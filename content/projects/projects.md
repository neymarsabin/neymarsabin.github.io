*Poison* is a **clean**, **professional** Hugo theme designed to **captivate** your readers.

It's also **tiny** and **privacy conscious**.  No JavaScript frameworks, icon packs, or Google fonts.  No ads or trackers polluting your console window.  **We kept things simple**.  A little vanilla JavaScript, a dash of CSS, and the power of Hugo.

All the static assets for the site (JS files, CSS, and fonts) are located within the theme's */assets/* directory.  **That way you know *exactly* what's going onto your site**.
